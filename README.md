This is a C# console application that is a simplified version of Mastermind.

After the player enters a combinatiokn, a minus(-) sign is printed for every digit that is correct but in a different position.
A plus(+) sign is printed for every digit that is correct and in a matching position.  Nothing is printed for digits not in the 
generated number.  A player may attempt to guess the generated number up to 10 times before losing the game.
